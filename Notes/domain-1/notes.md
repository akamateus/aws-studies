# üì∫ 6 Advantages of Cloud Computing

1. Trade fixed expense for variable expense ‚Äì Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you‚Äôre going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume.

2. Benefit from massive economies of scale ‚Äì By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.

3. Stop guessing capacity ‚Äì Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes‚Äô notice.

4. Increase speed and agility ‚Äì In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.

5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers ‚Äì Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.

6. Go global in minutes ‚Äì Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.

# üì∫ AWS High availability and scalability

Most providers of real-time communications align with service levels that provide availability from 99.9% to 99.999%. Depending on the degree of high availability (HA) that you want, you must take increasingly sophisticated measures along the full lifecycle of the application. AWS recommends following these guidelines to achieve a robust degree of high availability:

Design the system to have no single point of failure. Use automated monitoring, failure detection, and failover mechanisms for both stateless and stateful components

Single points of failure (SPOF) are commonly eliminated with an N+1 or 2N redundancy configuration, where N+1 is achieved via load balancing among active‚Äìactive nodes, and 2N is achieved by a pair of nodes in active‚Äìstandby configuration.

AWS has several methods for achieving HA through both approaches, such as through a scalable, load balanced cluster or assuming an active‚Äìstandby pair.

Correctly instrument and test system availability.

Prepare operating procedures for manual mechanisms to respond to, mitigate, and recover from the failure.

This section focuses on how to achieve no single point of failure using capabilities available on AWS. Specifically, this section describes a subset of core AWS capabilities and design patterns that allow you to build highly available real-time communication applications.

# üì∫ AWS Reliability Benefits

## Design your workload service architecture

Build highly scalable and reliable workloads using a service-oriented architecture (SOA) or a microservices architecture. Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is the practice of making software components reusable via service interfaces. Microservices architecture goes further to make components smaller and simpler.

Service-oriented architecture (SOA) interfaces use common communication standards so that they can be rapidly incorporated into new workloads. SOA replaced the practice of building monolith architectures, which consisted of interdependent, indivisible units.

At AWS, we have always used SOA, but have now embraced building our systems using microservices. While microservices have several attractive qualities, the most important benefit for availability is that microservices are smaller and simpler. They allow you to differentiate the availability required of different services, and thereby focus investments more specifically to the microservices that have the greatest availability needs. For example, to deliver product information pages on Amazon.com (‚Äúdetail pages‚Äù), hundreds of microservices are invoked to build discrete portions of the page. While there are a few services that must be available to provide the price and the product details, the vast majority of content on the page can simply be excluded if the service isn‚Äôt available. Even such things as photos and reviews are not required to provide an experience where a customer can buy a product.

# üì∫ CapEx vs OpEx

## The Role of Capital Expenses (CapEx)

Capital Expenditure (CapEx) refers to the funds a company invests in acquiring, upgrading, or maintaining physical assets such as buildings, machinery, equipment, or technology. These expenditures are typically for long-term use and are considered as investments that will provide value over an extended period. CapEx is recorded on the balance sheet and depreciated over time to reflect its diminishing value.

- TCO report & analysis

## The Role of Operational Expenses (OpEx)

Operating Expenditure (OpEx) encompasses the day-to-day expenses necessary for running a business. This includes costs like salaries, rent, utilities, office supplies, and other expenses required for normal business operations. Unlike CapEx, which is for long-term assets, OpEx is considered a short-term expense and is recorded on the income statement in the period in which it is incurred. OpEx is essential for sustaining ongoing business activities.

# üì∫ Software Licensing Impacts in the Cloud

The shift to cloud computing has revolutionized the way software is deployed, managed, and licensed. This transformation brings both opportunities and challenges in the realm of software licensing.

## Opportunities:

1. **Flexibility and Scalability:**
   Cloud environments offer unparalleled flexibility. Software licenses can be scaled up or down based on demand, allowing businesses to pay for only what they use. This scalability ensures cost efficiency and resource optimization.

2. **Cost-Efficient Licensing Models:**
   Cloud providers often offer pay-as-you-go or subscription-based licensing models. This eliminates the need for large upfront capital investments and allows organizations to align costs with actual usage, promoting financial efficiency.

3. **Global Accessibility:**
   Cloud platforms provide global access to software, enabling teams across different locations to use the same licensed applications seamlessly. This fosters collaboration and productivity in distributed work environments.

4. **Automatic Updates and Maintenance:**
   Cloud-based software solutions are often managed and updated by the service provider. This relieves organizations from the burden of manual updates and maintenance, ensuring they always have access to the latest features and security patches.

## Challenges:

1. **Complex Licensing Models:**
   Some software vendors have complex licensing agreements that may not align with cloud usage patterns. Understanding and managing these licenses can be a significant challenge, especially in multi-cloud or hybrid environments.

2. **License Compliance and Audits:**
   Ensuring compliance with software licenses, especially in dynamic cloud environments, requires meticulous tracking and management. Non-compliance can result in legal and financial consequences.

3. **Vendor Lock-In:**
   Depending heavily on one cloud provider for software licensing may lead to vendor lock-in. Transitioning to a different provider or on-premises infrastructure may be complex and costly.

4. **Data Sovereignty and Licensing Jurisdiction:**
   Cloud deployments may involve data residing in different geographical locations. This raises concerns about data sovereignty and the applicability of licensing terms based on jurisdiction.

In navigating the impacts of software licensing in the cloud, organizations must carefully evaluate their specific needs, choose appropriate licensing models, and implement robust management practices. Balancing cost-effectiveness with compliance and flexibility is key to maximizing the benefits of cloud-based software solutions.
