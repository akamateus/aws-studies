# Cloud Terminology

If you’re new to cloud computing and the IT field in general,
you may come across a lot of new terms you haven’t heard of before.
As you come across these, I’d suggest to actively lookup what they
mean and come up with your own definitions for them to help solidify
your understanding.

While this is not a full list of the terms of the terms you’ll come
across in your study, these should help understand the basic “language”
of cloud computing:

Another good reference is the AWS Glossary. Now I wouldn’t suggest
you need to read through this whole thing, but perhaps bookmark the
link in case you come across an AWS service or term you’re not really
sure about to quickly look up what it means.
