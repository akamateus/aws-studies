# ðŸ“º AWS Regions, Availability Zones & Edge Locations

- Region: Physical location, 26 regions. Choose the best location based on your end-user(costumers). Your data is isolated in a region by default.
  _Important fact:_ AWS regions contain 2 or more AZs.

- Availability Zones: Is a logical zone, made by one or more data centers.

# ðŸ“º Multi-Region Use Cases

1. Compliance Requirements: Data Residency, Company Policy, Business Reasons

2. AWS Service Availability: Are the services you require available here/there?

3. Regions closest to your customers: Reduced application latency (Happy costumers)

4. Regional Costs: Check the price differences of services and data transfer
