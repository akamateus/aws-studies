# ðŸ“º AWS Regions, Availability Zones & Edge Locations

- Region: Physical location, 26 regions. Choose the best location based on your end-user(costumers). Your data is isolated in a region by default.
  _Important fact:_ AWS regions contain 2 or more AZs.

- Availability Zones: Is a logical zone, made by one or more data centers.

## ðŸ“º Multi-Region Use Cases

1. Compliance Requirements: Data Residency, Company Policy, Business Reasons

2. AWS Service Availability: Are the services you require available here/there?

3. Regions closest to your customers: Reduced application latency (Happy costumers)

4. Regional Costs: Check the price differences of services and data transfer

## ðŸ“º AWS EC2 Instance types & Serverless Compute on Amazon Web Services

_Check the Instance Types_ [here](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2/?trk=b59ef3d1-61fa-4eea-9a0b-96fbd6584e69&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=Cj0KCQjw-pyqBhDmARIsAKd9XIO82ID1IwteU4A7FztJy3u2v8LczBKwWm4DMojU9z_dJO0l0gU0uFwaArNHEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!645133569804!e!!g!!amazon%20ec2%20instance!19579892353!148838338441)

_Amazon Elastic Container Service_ [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/): Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS): Is a fully managed container orchestration service that helps you to more efficiently deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. It deeply integrates with the AWS environment to provide an easy-to-use solution for running container workloads in the cloud and on premises with advanced security features using Amazon ECS Anywhere.

_Check the AWS Lambda_ [here](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda/?trk=5e541ab3-2fcc-4151-9e08-fdea53dc7fb8&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=Cj0KCQiAuqKqBhDxARIsAFZELmKTw-AO4Rgas0muqz8ayKzsF446Ja2e25xxrvXBLzC0-U1GUhIBcWAaAhFzEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!651541907473!e!!g!!aws%20lambda!19836375769!150670855801): By combining AWS Lambda with other AWS services, developers can build powerful web applications that automatically scale up and down and run in a highly available configuration across multiple data centers â€“ with zero administrative effort required for scalability, back-ups, or multi-data center redundancy.

_Amazon EKS_ [here](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/): Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed Kubernetes service to run Kubernetes in the AWS cloud and on-premises data centers. In the cloud, Amazon EKS automatically manages the availability and scalability of the Kubernetes control plane nodes responsible for scheduling containers, managing application availability, storing cluster data, and other key tasks. With Amazon EKS, you can take advantage of all the performance, scale, reliability, and availability of AWS infrastructure, as well as integrations with AWS networking and security services. On-premises, EKS provides a consistent, fully-supported Kubernetes solution with integrated tooling and simple deployment to AWS Outposts, virtual machines, or bare metal servers.

## ðŸ“º EC2 Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)

_AWS Auto Scaling_ [here](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/): AWS Auto Scaling monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. Using AWS Auto Scaling, itâ€™s easy to setup application scaling for multiple resources across multiple services in minutes. The service provides a simple, powerful user interface that lets you build scaling plans for resources including Amazon EC2 instances and Spot Fleets, Amazon ECS tasks, Amazon DynamoDB tables and indexes, and Amazon Aurora Replicas.

## ðŸ“º Amazon S3 Storage Services

s3: objected related for db, doesn't care about the type o data. AWS provides 99,9% of object durability. S3 also offer object versioning.

## ðŸ“º Amazon Virtual Cloud (VPC)

With Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), you can launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

The following diagram shows an example VPC. The VPC has one subnet in each of the Availability Zones in the Region, EC2 instances in each subnet, and an internet gateway to allow communication between the resources in your VPC and the internet.

## AWS Direct Connect

The AWS Direct Connect cloud service is the shortest path to your AWS resources. While in transit, your network traffic remains on the AWS global network and never touches the public internet. This reduces the chance of hitting bottlenecks or unexpected increases in latency. When creating a new connection, you can choose a hosted connection provided by an AWS Direct Connect Delivery Partner, or choose a dedicated connection from AWSâ€”and deploy at over 100 AWS Direct Connect locations around the globe. With AWS Direct Connect SiteLink, you can send data between AWS Direct Connect locations to create private network connections between the offices and data centers in your global network.
